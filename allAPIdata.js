You can use an immersion blender for the same. Another way is to add all the ingredients in a blender jar and blend until smooth and frothy. Now add the crushed cardamom powder and saffron strands. Mix well. Do check the taste and add more sugar if required.", "As a substitute for cardamom powder, add rose water. You can skip all the flavoring ingredients, if you don't have any.

With a wired whisk blend everything well till smooth. A blender or an immersion blender also works. ", "Pour the salted lassi in glasses. Garnish with mint leaves.
