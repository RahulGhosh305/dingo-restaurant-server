The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of South Asia. You might hear mutton being described as 'gamey' because the flavour is strong and rich, mellowing when the meat is cooked. The rich flavour of mutton will hold up against an equally bold sauce, so it's the perfect choice for a hearty Autumnal curry or tagine-style stew. Not only is it a rich source of high-quality protein, but it is also an outstanding source of many vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. Because of this, regular consumption of lamb may promote muscle growth, maintenance, and performance. Mutton, meat from sheep, is not particularly popular because it has a very distinct flavour that many do not like. It is considered a red meat, and probably should not be consumed in excess, like beef. But we know how carefully people limit their beef consumption. Basically, it is food.",

Next, put a large pan over medium flame and melt ghee in it. Once the ghee has melted, add cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, cinnamon stick. Saute these for a minute and add the sliced onions along with salt in it. Saute till the onion turns light brown in colour. Next, add the ginger paste along with garlic paste and cook the mixture until the raw smell disappears.", "2. Now, add turmeric powder, red chilli powder and coriander powder to the fried onion and mix it well. Add the mashed tomatoes and mix them well with the other ingredients.

Ensure that mutton pieces are evenly coated with the masala. Pour the yoghurt in the mutton masala and mix it well. Let it cook for 4-5 minutes and, then, add water to it. Stir it well and check the seasoning once. Then, add chopped coriander leaves along with garam masala powder. Give it a quick stir. Cook it for another 25 minutes to ensure that mutton is no longer raw and is perfectly juicy.", "4. Once done, take it off the flame and transfer the dish to a bowl. Serve it hot with rice or naan to enjoy! You can also garnish the dish with chopped green chillies and julienned ginger if you want.

        "longDesc" : "Chicken nuggets may look appealing on the outside, with their golden fried batter, but what’s inside is far more disturbing. Chicken nuggets are made with white chicken meat that comes from the breast or pectoral muscles of the birds, and other chicken parts can be mixed in as well. Tendons, bones, nervous and connective tissues, and fat can all be ground up together before being shaped into those bite-sized pieces. One study found that chicken nuggets contained more fat than meat, along with bone, nerve, and connective tissue. Of course, manufacturers and brands have varying recipes, and these are often well-guarded secrets. Some may contain more meat with fewer additives or other materials, but when you find out how chicken nuggets are made, you'll want to leave them off your plate regardless.",

Remove a piece of chicken from the flour, dip in the egg mixture, then the breadcrumbs, gently pressing the crumbs into the chicken, and set on a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining pieces of chicken. ", "3. Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces to the pan (work in batches if needed) and brown on each side, about 8 minutes total. Use a spatula to transfer the chicken nuggets to a paper-towel-lined plate.

        "longDesc" : "There's something inherently appealing about a small burger. Perhaps, culturally speaking, it stems from the same place as our interest in puppies, kittens, and the Fiat 500: it's the equivalent of something we really like, only smaller. But in a time when burgers can occasionally be dauntingly huge, with arrays of toppings that can sometimes veer into the baroque and even ridiculous, the mini-burger is reassuringly simple: a patty, a bun, and (usually) some variety of topping–including cheese, sauce, and onions, depending on the restaurant. For all of its simplicity, the mini-burger is also a magnificently versatile item. You'll find them listed as entrees on some menus, and as appetizers on others. There's also the question of where, exactly, the distinction between mini-burgers and sliders can be found, which can be more divisive than one might expect. For the record, several of the people interviewed for this article argued that the two are one and the same. For us mini-burgers and sliders are the same thing, although the size varies greatly from place to place, said Anthony Malone of the New York City bar and restaurant Swift's Hibernian Lounge, which has been serving mini-burgers for the last ten years.",

        "Directions": ["1. Heat a skillet on medium-high. Add guajillo peppers and toast for 5 minutes. Remove peppers and set aside. Place garlic in the pan, with skin still intact and toast on both sides until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside.",
            "2. Cut the stems off the guajillo peppers and discard seeds. Use scissors to cut the peppers into small pieces in a medium bowl. Pour boiling water over top until the peppers are covered and set aside to rehydrate for 15 minutes.",
            "3. Meanwhile, make the jalapeno guacamole by mashing together the avocado, lime juice, diced jalapeno, cilantro and ¼ tsp salt. Set aside until serving.",
            "4. Once the guajillo peppers are rehydrated, remove the skins from the garlic and place in the container of a blender. Add chopped onion, water, brown sugar, tomato paste, cider vinegar and ¼ tsp salt. Strain the guajillo peppers and add them to the blender. Pulse on high until smooth, then pass the guajillo ketchup through a sieve. Discard the seeds and skin, and reserve the ketchup for serving.",
            "5. Preheat BBQ on high heat. Form the ground beef into 4 patties and season with ancho chili, remaining salt and pepper. Place on the grill and cook for 5 minutes per side or until medium-well. Add queso fresco once the burgers are flipped. Toast the buns for the final minute of cooking. Remove the buns and burgers and allow to rest for 3 minutes.",
            "6. To assemble, spread a spoonful of jalapeno guacamole on the bottom bun. Top with a handful of tortilla chips and place burger on top.
