The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of South Asia. You might hear mutton being described as 'gamey' because the flavour is strong and rich, mellowing when the meat is cooked. The rich flavour of mutton will hold up against an equally bold sauce, so it's the perfect choice for a hearty Autumnal curry or tagine-style stew. Not only is it a rich source of high-quality protein, but it is also an outstanding source of many vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. Because of this, regular consumption of lamb may promote muscle growth, maintenance, and performance. Mutton, meat from sheep, is not particularly popular because it has a very distinct flavour that many do not like.

But the creamy, meatless broth behind tantanmen stands up formidably to the challenge, coming together in little time without sacrificing flavor or body.Tantanmen, which finds its origins in the Sichuan dish dan dan noodles, derives its power not from a labored broth, but from a mildly sweet soy milk base combined with flavorful seasonings, which the Japanese call tare.Here, buttery Chinese or Japanese sesame paste, which has a richer and more robust finish than tahini, is paired with soy sauce, rice vinegar, chile oil and sugar to impart earthiness to the broth.

Chicken nuggets are made with white chicken meat that comes from the breast or pectoral muscles of the birds, and other chicken parts can be mixed in as well. Tendons, bones, nervous and connective tissues, and fat can all be ground up together before being shaped into those bite-sized pieces. One study found that chicken nuggets contained more fat than meat, along with bone, nerve, and connective tissue. Of course, manufacturers and brands have varying recipes, and these are often well-guarded secrets. Some may contain more meat with fewer additives or other materials, but when you find out how chicken nuggets are made, you'll want to leave them off your plate regardless.",

        "longDesc" : "There's something inherently appealing about a small burger. Perhaps, culturally speaking, it stems from the same place as our interest in puppies, kittens, and the Fiat 500: it's the equivalent of something we really like, only smaller. But in a time when burgers can occasionally be dauntingly huge, with arrays of toppings that can sometimes veer into the baroque and even ridiculous, the mini-burger is reassuringly simple: a patty, a bun, and (usually) some variety of toppingâincluding cheese, sauce, and onions, depending on the restaurant. For all of its simplicity, the mini-burger is also a magnificently versatile item. You'll find them listed as entrees on some menus, and as appetizers on others. There's also the question of where, exactly, the distinction between mini-burgers and sliders can be found, which can be more divisive than one might expect. For the record, several of the people interviewed for this article argued that the two are one and the same. For us mini-burgers and sliders are the same thing, although the size varies greatly from place to place, said Anthony Malone of the New York City bar and restaurant Swift's Hibernian Lounge, which has been serving mini-burgers for the last ten years.",

Pulse on high until smooth, then pass the guajillo ketchup through a sieve. Discard the seeds and skin, and reserve the ketchup for serving.",
